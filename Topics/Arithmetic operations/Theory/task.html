<h2>Arithmetic operations</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>We often perform <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10776" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="An arithmetic operation in Kotlin refers to the process of performing mathematical calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo division on one or more values or variables. | These operations are typically represented by special symbols called operators, which take two operands (the values or variables being operated on) and produce a result. For example, in the expression `5 + 3`, `5` and `3` are the operands, and `+` is the addition operator. The result of this operation would be `8`.">arithmetic operations</a> in our daily life. We need to calculate the change, measure the area of a room, count the number of people in a queue, and so on. The computer can help us with these operations.</p>

<li><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/4652" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, multiplication is a basic arithmetic operation that can be performed using the `*` operator. | It allows you to multiply two numbers together. For example, if you have two variables `a` and `b`, you can multiply them by writing `a * b`. The result of this operation will be the product of `a` and `b`.

<p>These operators are binary, which means they take two values as operands. The operand is the value or <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/4371" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a variable is a storage for a value, which can be a string, a number, or something else. | Every variable has a name (or an identifier) to distinguish it from other variables. You can access a value by the name of the variable. Variables are one of the most often used elements in programming, so it is important to understand how to use them. Before you can start using a variable, you must declare it. To declare a variable, Kotlin provides two keywords: `val` and `var`.">variable</a> the operator is being applied to. For example, in expression 1 + 3, 1 and 3 are the operands, and + is the operator.</p>

<h5 id="complex-expressions" style="text-align: center;">Complex expressions</h5>
<p>You can combine arithmetic operations to write <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/26442" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A complex expression in Kotlin is a combination of multiple expressions that are evaluated together to produce a single result. | It is created by using various operators, functions, and statements to manipulate and combine values, resulting in a more intricate and sophisticated outcome.

For instance, the logical operators NOT, XOR, AND, and OR have a specific precedence that dictates how they are evaluated. This concept is crucial for writing clear and concise code, as it ensures that operations are carried out in the intended order. By understanding operator precedence, developers can avoid ambiguity and potential errors in their code.">priority</a> than addition or subtraction, so <code class="language-kotlin">3 * 4</code> is calculated first.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Consider an expression as a part of code that produces a value (for example, <code class="language-kotlin">14 + 5</code> or <code class="language-kotlin">15 - 3 * 4</code>). Further, we will take a closer look at expressions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Use <strong>parentheses </strong>to specify the order of execution.<strong> </strong>Let's take a look at the example below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">println((1 + 3) * (4 - 2)) // prints 8
</code></pre>
<p><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/4525" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, parentheses can be used to change the order of execution of expressions. | They can be used to group variables and operators together in a specific way, which can be useful when there are multiple operators with different precedence levels in an expression. Parentheses can also be used to make code more readable by clarifying the intended grouping of variables and operators.">Parentheses</a> can be nested. You can also use them to simplify the notation.</p>
<p>For example, here is a program that prints all digits of the number <code class="language-kotlin">54</code> in reverse order. We will use arithmetic operations to extract the digits.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    println(54 % 10) // it prints 4
    println((54 / 10) % 10) // it prints 5

<h5 id="unary-operators" style="text-align: center;">Unary operators</h5>
<p>A <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/26442" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a unary operator is an operator that operates on only one operand or value. | For example, the unary minus operator (-) can be used to negate a number. In the following example, the unary minus operator is used to negate the value of the variable x:
```
val x = 10
val y = -x
```
In this example, the value of y will be -10. Other examples of unary operators in Kotlin include the increment (++) and decrement (--) operators.">unary operator</a> takes a single value as the operand.</p>
<ul>
<li>A<strong> unary plus</strong> just gives you a value. It is an optional operator, so you omit it in practice:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">println(+5) // prints 5
println(+(-5)) // prints -5
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>unary minus</strong> negates a value or expression:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">println(-8)  // prints -8

<p>They both have <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/14438" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, higher precedence refers to the order in which operations are performed in an expression. | Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before those with lower precedence. For example, multiplication has higher precedence than addition, so if you have an expression like 2 + 3 \* 4, the multiplication will be performed first, resulting in 14 + 3 = 17. Parentheses can be used to increase the priority of an operation or to make the code clearer.">higher precedence</a> </strong>than the multiplication and division operators.</p>
<h5 id="precedence-order" style="text-align: center;">Precedence order</h5>
<p>Take a look at the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/14438" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, the precedence order determines how operators are grouped in the absence of parentheses. | The four main logical operators in Kotlin are not, exclusive or, and, and or. Precedence is higher for not, followed by exclusive or, and then and and or. Multiplication and addition have higher precedence than logical operators, so they are calculated first. Parentheses can be used to increase the priority of an operation or for clarity.

<p>Mind this order: it's important for correct calculations. Also, you can use the acronym BODMAS (Brackets, Order, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction) to remember priority.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion" style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h5>
<p>In this topic, we have covered five main arithmetic operations (<code class="language-kotlin">+</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">-</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">*</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">/</code>, and <code class="language-kotlin">%</code>). Of course, you can combine them into complex expressions with parenthesis (to simplify the notation) and with unary operators. However, mind the precedence. The good news is that in Kotlin, the precedence order follows the rules you've learned in high school.</p>
